# Minimum requirements, all of these must be present in at least one place in your code:
- [x] When the game ends, you must have functionality to write a transcript of the game to a file.  Format you use to write the data is flexible, each game must contain player information and all moves. You can either store the result of each round, or re-calculate it.
- [x] You must have functionality to read a transcript of a game from a file.  
- [x] You must define at least one struct object and use at least one instance of it.
- [x] You must use at least one array.
- [x] You must use pointers in a constructive way in one place in your code, and you must use pointer arithmetic at least once.
- [x] You must have at least 10 features (see below).  If you work with a partner, there must be 15 points of features.

# Suggested Features:
## Tally: 10
- [x] The game is set up to have either two human players or one computer player or two computer players.
- [ ] Make it Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
- [ ] The file always contains one and only one game transcript, stored as ASCII text.  The program can read a transcript from a file and show the game transcript to the user.
- [x] The file can have multiple games, stored with some identifying information.  When the user is going to read from the file, they get to pick which game to read based on the identifying information.
- [x] The file is in binary format, or in CSV format, tested to be recognized and readable by a spreadsheet program.
- [x] Define one instance of one struct type.
- [ ] Define and use one enum data type.
- [ ] Define multiple different struct types.
- [ ] Define and use multiple enum data types.
- [x] Define multiple different instances of one struct object (can be repeated for two struct types for 2 pts)
- [x] Pass an array or a struct to a function, or return an array or a struct from a function. You can earn up to 4 points for doing both directions and/or both arrays and structs.  You can use the same or different functions for any of this.
    - [x] Pass array
    - [ ] Return array
    - [ ] Pass struct
    - [ ] Return struct
- [x] Define one array.
- [x] Define multiple different arrays.
- [x] Use pointers once, and use pointer arithmetic once.
- [x] Use pointers to multiple objects.
- [x] Use pointer arithmetic productively in more than one place.
- [x] Pass one or more pointers to one or more functions.
- [ ] Return one or more pointers from one or more functions.
- [ ] Uhhâ€¦ make something up.  We can talk, I'll give you some points for it.
